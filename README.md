# Menu Script

A customizable, terminal-based menu system that allows users to easily navigate files, run programs, and access custom functions. This script is highly configurable and supports adding new menu options, customizing greetings, and adjusting the appearance of the menu.

## Features

- **Customizable Greetings**: Displays different greetings based on the time of day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night).
- **File Browser**: Navigate through directories and open files for editing.
- **Command Launcher**: Run custom commands or predefined terminal programs from the menu.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Customize the menu, appearance, greetings, and programs via a simple `config.yaml` file.

## Installation

To install the script, follow these steps:

1. Make the `install.sh` script executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x install.sh

3. After installation, you can run the menu script with:
